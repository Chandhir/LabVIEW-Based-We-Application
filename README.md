# LabVIEW-Based-We-Application
This LabVIEW-based web application uses LabVIEW code as the server and JavaScript code as the client.

## Overview

This web application is designed to remotely monitor and control LabVIEW-based ATE (Automated Test Equipment) systems. It consists of two parts:

#### Server (LabVIEW): Runs on each test PC (ATE01, ATE02, etc.), exposing web services to deliver test status and front panel images.

#### Client (Web Dashboard): A browser-based JavaScript application (HTML/CSS/JS) hosted separately, used to login and monitor multiple ATE systems from a centralized dashboard.

## System Architecture

+--------------------+         HTTP POST Requests         +---------------------+
| Web Client (User)  | <--------------------------------> | LabVIEW HTTP Server |
| Runs in browser    |     (GetFP_Image, Request_Message) | (ATE01, ATE02...)    |
+--------------------+                                     +---------------------+

3. Monitoring a Test System

Click View on any ATE card

A new screen opens displaying:

Live Front Panel Image of the LabVIEW VI

Status of the test system

Control buttons: Start, Pause, Terminate

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot Placeholder: Monitor Screen with Controls and Image

4. Commands to LabVIEW

The following POST requests are sent from the web client:

Command

Endpoint URL (example)

Payload

Get FP Image - http://<ATE-IP>:8001/TSM_WebService/GetFP_Image <br>

Get Status - http://<ATE-IP>:8001/TSM_WebService/GetTestStatus <br>

Send Command -  http://<ATE-IP>:8001/TSM_WebService/Request_Message <br>

5. Logout

Click Logout in the left menu

You will be redirected back to the login screen

## Deployment Steps

Host the folder labview-multi-ate-client on a local or remote web server

Ensure LabVIEW web services are running on each ATE system

Update IP addresses in app.js or systems.json

Access login.html from any browser
